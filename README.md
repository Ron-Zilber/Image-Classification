Deep Learning project to implement image classification neural network and comparing accuracies between two models.
Developed as an assignment in Machine Learning course at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben - Gurion University of the Negev (gradaed 100).

Dataset is composed of large amount of pictures of shoe pairs (left and right), such that positive examples are pairs with matching shoes, and negative examples are permutated pairs.
The model is designed to detect whether a given pair of shoes is correct pair or not.

Relevant stack:
Python, PyTorch, Pandas, numPy.
